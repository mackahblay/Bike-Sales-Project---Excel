**Project Title:** Bike Sales Analysis: Understanding Consumer Behavior

**Project Overview:**
This project delves into the world of bike sales, aiming to understand consumer behavior based on various demographic factors. The dataset used includes information on marital status, age, age range, education, miles ridden, income, number of children, and more. By analyzing this data and creating insightful visualizations, we can draw valuable inferences about what drives bike purchases.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze bike sales data and create meaningful visualizations to uncover trends and patterns related to consumer behavior. By using Excel's powerful tools, such as pivot tables, charts, and slicers, we aim to provide an interactive and detailed exploration of the dataset.

**Key Visualizations:**
1. **Income vs. Bike Purchases:**
   - This graph compares income levels against the number of bike purchases.
   - Users can use the slicer to filter data, such as comparing individuals making $100,000 in the US and their bike purchase behavior.
   - Insights from this graph can reveal how income influences bike buying decisions.

2. **Commuters vs. Miles Ridden:**
   - Here, we analyze the relationship between the number of commuters and the miles they ride.
   - The slicer allows for a granular view, such as focusing on commuters in specific age groups or income brackets.
   - This graph helps us understand if commuters tend to ride longer distances and if so, how various factors impact this behavior.

3. **Age Range vs. Number of Bikers:**
   - This visualization explores the distribution of bikers across different age ranges.
   - By utilizing the slicer, users can zoom in on specific age ranges or combine filters to compare demographics.
   - Understanding age demographics can provide insights into which age groups are more likely to engage in biking.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - The raw data was cleaned to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and ensure consistency.
   - Categorization of variables like age into ranges was performed for better analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Basic statistical analysis was conducted to gain initial insights into the data.
   - Pivot tables were used to summarize and aggregate data based on different variables.

3. **Visualization Creation:**
   - Graphs were created using Excel charts, focusing on clarity and interpretability.
   - Each graph includes slicers for interactivity, enabling users to drill down into specific segments of the data.

4. **Inference and Analysis:**
   - From the visualizations, we drew inferences about the relationships between variables.
   - Hypotheses were tested regarding how factors like income, age, and commuter status impact bike purchases and usage.

**Insights:**
**INSIGHTS FROM THE 'AVERAGE INCOME PER BIKE PURCHASE GRAPH':**
  - Concerning commuters who earn over $57,000, only males purchased bikes
  - Filtering by commuters who have a Bachelor's degree, there are significantly more women who bike than those who do not 
  - In the young people age group (34 or younger), there are more female commuters than male
  - For those who earn $20,0000 or less, there is a near-even split of bike vs non-bikers commuters at 50.5%
  - Filtering by marital status, there are way more men who purchase bikes than otherwise. In women, single women are much less likely to purchase a bike
  - Single women who owned cars were more likely to purchase by bike
  - Among young people who do not own a car, both men and women were less likely to purchase a bike
  - Married people with a graduate degree were less likely to purchase a bike
  - Single people with a partial high school education were more likely to purchase a bike
  - Middle age women, with a partial high school education, and 2 cars who earned $70,000 owned a bike, whereas their male counterparts did not
    
**INSIGHTS FROM THE 'COMMUTERS VS DISTANCE TRAVELED GRAPH':**
  - Most covered travel a distance of 0-1 miles on average
  - More male commutes travel 5-10 miles vs female commuters
  - Most old commuters (60 or older) travel 5-10 miles on average
  - Most commuters in North America travel 2-5 miles on average
  - Commuters who earn $130,000 or more travel 5-10 miles on average
  - Young commuters in Europe travel 2-5 miles on average
  - Middle-aged men travel a distance of 0-1 miles on average
  - Most commuters in Europe and North America travel 0-1 miles on average
  - In the Pacific, most commuters travel 0-1 miles on average followed closely by 5-10 miles
  - Old people in the Pacific travel 5-10 miles on average
  - Men in the Pacific travel 5-10 miles on average
  - People who earn over $100,000 in the Pacific travel 10+ miles on average
  - North Americans who earn $50,000 or less travel 1-2 miles on average
  - Europeans who earn $80-000 to $100,000 travel 2-5 miles on average
  - Young people who earn $30,000 travel 0-1 miles on average
  - Female commuters who earn $120,000 travel 10+ miles on average
  - Old people who earn $70,000 travel 10+ miles on average

**INSIGHTS FROM THE 'AGE RANGE VS NUMBER OF BIKERS GRAPH':**
  - Middle-aged people had the largest share of bikers
  - The 'Old' age range category had the least share of bikers
  - For commuters who earn $100,000, 'Middle-age' and 'Old' age range had the joint largest share of bikers
  - Among men who travel 10+ miles, the middle-aged group had the largest share of bikers, followed closely by the 'Young' age range
  - Among women in the Pacific who earned $70,000, there were no bikers in the 'Old' age range
  - Comparing North American women who earned $40,000 or less, those in the 'Old' age range had the least share of bikers
  - About 70% of all commuters were middle-aged
  - The second largest age group of commuters across all regions were young people
  - Among people who earned $100,000 to $150,000 more young people owned bikes than not
  - Among North Americans who earned $100,000 to $150,000 more people across all age groups did not own bikes than did
    
**Conclusion:**
This Excel project offers a comprehensive analysis of bike sales data, providing valuable insights into consumer behavior. The interactive nature of the visualizations, with slicers for customization, allows for a detailed exploration of the dataset. By understanding the relationships between income, commuter status, age, and bike purchases, businesses can make informed decisions to target their market effectively.
